# Flow Examples

This project serves as a place to explore the Flow library and to provide examples of how to use the classes contained therein.

## Ideas?

If you are interested in understanding a specific class or function or would like to see an example of how to use something, consider creating an Issue on GitHub.  https://github.com/calledtoconstruct/flow/issues

## Know of a better way to do the same thing?

At this point, this is an experimental project.  The intention is to explore possibilities.  There may well be more efficient, more readable, more maintainable, or just plain "better" ways to accomplish the same thing.  If you have some ideas for how to improve the library, please consider sharing thme with the collaborators, fork the project, submit pull-requests, and / or publish your ideas online and share.
